## Introduction

Welcome to Katsura. This is a mobile application built using React Native and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to make orders for food of their choice.

## Feature

1. Browse: Users can explore a wide range of restaurants and their menus. They can filter and search for specific cuisines, dishes, or restaurants based on their preferences.
2. Order: Users can select items from the menu, customize their order (e.g., choose toppings, specify dietary preferences), and add items to their cart. They can also view the order summary before placing it.
3. Payment: The app supports secure payment methods, such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or cash on delivery. Users can securely complete their transactions within the app.
4. Track Order: Once an order is placed, users can track the status of their order in real time. They receive updates on the preparation, packaging, and delivery stages. Notifications keep them informed about estimated delivery times.
5. User Profiles: Users can create and manage their profiles within the app. They can save their delivery addresses, payment details, and favorite restaurants for a personalized experience.

## Technologies

These are the main technologies that I used. You can check the other dependencies in `package.json`.

1. React Native: A popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.
2. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building responsive user interfaces.

## Installation

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account
2. Clone the project to your local machine.
3. Navigate to your folder and run `npx expo install`
4. Start the development server: `npx expo start`. This command will launch the Expo development server and provide you with options to run the app on an emulator, physical device, or web browser.
